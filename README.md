### Why?

We could build our own calendar, but it going to involve a lot of CSS styles which will get messy due to the "absolute" positioning of things. So instead let's rely on a community built library.

### Getting Started
This project was scaffolded using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
1. have `yarn` package manager availiable
2. `yarn install` from the root directory
3. `yarn run dev` to start the project
4. View in browser
5. Play around with primary code at https://github.com/cody-elhard/my-vue-app/blob/main/src/App.jsx
